## Aaron Fonseca Assignment 1

# Systems and Tools Assignment Directions

Activity Directions:

Explore various features of the operating system on your computer. Choose 5 features and explain what (in your opinion) do you think happens when you access them. For example, access the list of files in a folder. Try to explain what happens “behind the scenes” inside the operating system. Use your own words and do not attempt to search for the answer on the Internet. 

You will be evaluated based on your ability to explain what you think happens and NOT based on how correct you are. Later in this class you will have the opportunity to revisit your explanation and assess how correct and accurate you actually were, with a greater deal of technical detail.

In addition, as preparation for subsequent projects, you are required to demonstrate readiness to write and run C programs in a Linux or UNIX environment. If you are using a Mac, you already have UNIX. If you are using a Windows PC, install a Linux distribution. Use a UNIX/Linux text editor (touch, vi, emacs) to create a simple HellowWorld.c file. Compile and execute the simple HelloWorld.o program (see separate links to resources on Linux, UNIX, and C) using the C compiler included in your UNIX/Linux installation:

/* Hello World program */

#include<stdio.h>;

main()

{

printf("Hello World");

}

Then:

1. Create a directory called CST-221 and initialize it as your local Git repository.
2. Create a README file and type in a brief introduction of yourself.
3. Create a directory inside CST-221, called Assignment1.
4. Create and compile HelloWorld.c in the Assignment1 directory.
5. Commit the README file and Assignment1 directory, and push them to the remote Git repository (using the account given to you by GCU).

Deliverables:

1. Title page (name, course, assignment name, date)

2. Operating system exploration results:

a. A table listing the features, what exactly you did to access each one, and your explanation on how do you think it works.

b. A set of screenshots showing the testing of each feature.

c. A list of resources you used (e.g., software, web sites, articles)

3. Screenshots showing availability of UNIX or Linux on your computer.

4. Screenshot showing successful execution of the HelloWorld.c program.

5. Package all of the above into one document and upload it to LoudCloud.

6. Upload the README and HelloWorld.c files
